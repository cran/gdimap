  o using 'Rniftilib' instead of 'oro.nifti' for reading/writing NiFTI datasets

Changes in gdimap version 0.1-6

  o In 'vmf' functions principal diffusion directions (PDD)
    are now sorted  by 'alpha' (fitted mixture probabilities).
  o Support for non-default control parameters in 'movMF' calls
  o Changed normalization for glyph visualization to agree with
    theta/|theta|.
  o Eliminated 'snapshot' function args.

Changes in gdimap version 0.1-4

  o minor corrections

Changes in gdimap version 0.1-1

  o ODF reconstructions now supports two GQI methods (QBI and QBI2),
    and one QBI method.
  o New functions for fibre orientation estimation and visualization.
  o Simulations via 'simulglyph.vmf' now supports GQI, GQI2, and QBI.
  o The masked data set 'data_brain' has been removed since it is not
    used directly.
  o Allow fiber simulations with different volume fractions
  o Hacked geometry::surf.tri() to supress warnings
  o Filename 'dsi203_bmax4000.txt' substituted by 'btable.txt'
  o Format of file 'data.bvec' modified to 'scan' format as produced by
    the 'dcm2nii' tool, and compatible with the formats used in the
    'DSI_Studio' and 'Dipy' toolboxes.
  o Documentation has been updated.

Changes in gdimap version 0.0-3
